# Elm Arbok

This is an experiment with how an Elm implementation of Arbok would simplify things. 

To get this running make sure you have [elm installed](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) then just do:

```
make
```

this will build a `index.html` file.

for development I would sugest using:

```
elm-reactor
```

elm-live is cool too though.
